We're thrilled that you are interested in becoming a Mentor for CodingNomads. This document describes what mentorship means to CodingNomads, and what we look for in an ideal mentor. Please read this document carefully. If you have questions please reach out to Ryan, via . Getting Started What Mentorship Means To Us What We Don't Do What We Look For In A Mentor What Mentorship Means To Us \u00b6 At CodingNomads, mentorship means that we care for our students as the individual person they are, and that we try our best to help students have an enjoyable, productive and meaningful learning process. Think of yourself as a knowledgeable learning buddy to your student. Your mentee should feel comfortable contacting you when they need you. As a great mentor, you know the course material well and you know how to efficiently find solutions which you don't yet have. One important lesson is to help your students to learn how to figure challenges out by themselves. That means that you will already know the answer, but you don't tell the solution to your student directly. Instead, when and where possible, you guide them on the path of figuring it out themselves. As a mentor, you know that it's ultimately the student's effort that makes the difference whether they will learn a lot or only a little. However, you also know that there is so much you can do to make it easier for your mentees to sit down and take that necessary effort. Check in with your students frequently, make them understand that you care for their learning process and that you are available to help. Be polite, positive, fun, and encouraging - and help your students with creating learning plans and sticking to them. Get to know your students, be compassionate, and try your best to improve the learning process for each individual student that you are working with. In a nutshell, mentorship at CodingNomads is all about caring . When a student knows that they have a mentor who cares about their learning and their progress, it's a game changer. At CodingNomads, we want our mentors to be game changers. Mentor Tips What We Don't Do \u00b6 We never make our students feel insecure about not knowing something. We don't assume that a student \"should\" know something already. If they don't know something, we patiently explain. We don't discriminate against anyone for any reason. We're all humans here, let's be nice to each other. What We Look For In A Mentor \u00b6 We want to work with mentors who know their topics well and enjoy helping others learn . If you want to mentor e.g. for our Python course, you should know Python well. If you want to mentor for Java, you should know Java. The course that you are mentoring for should be a rich learning experience for your student, which requires a certain level of expertise and fluidity with the technology. That said, we care a lot about professional development and want to give you opportunities to grow as well. We want to work with mentors who are interested in learning and education, who want to improve their own capacities as programmers and educators. Because of this, mentors who have worked with us for more than 1 year will have the opportunity to take any of our online courses free of charge. We want to work with mentors who are excited to give input and suggestions to us and their fellow mentors, as well as learn from our students and mentor community. We want to work with mentors who are motivated to help with improving CodingNomads' courses and mentorship service for the benefit of all our students.","title":"Requirements"},{"location":"01_requirements/#getting-started","text":"Welcome!

CodingNomads Mentorship Process Starting To Work With A Student First Call CORE DUTY #1: Make Your Support Felt Get To Know Your Student Answer Discord Questions Stay Up-To-Date With Your Students' Progress Code Review The Capstone Project Capstone Review Guidance CORE DUTY #2: Weekly 1-On-1 Calls Set Weekly Goals Every Week Set A Fixed Meeting Time Help Your Students Come Prepared Know What To Talk About Recording Video Calls Submit Support Logs Weekly Mentor Standup Time Tracking With TopTracker Wrap Up Working With A Student Progress Notifications The Final Call Troubleshooting Mentor Support And Questions Starting To Work With A Student \u00b6 After you've become a part of our mentor community, we will want to connect you with students. This happens as follows: Availability : We reach out to you to see if you're available to take on a new student. Student Info : Once you accept, we'll send you the student's background info. First Contact : We send a shared email to both you and your student, to establish the initial contact. We will also create a dedicated Discord channel for you and your mentee. After we share an introduction, please respond at your earliest convenience rather than waiting for the student to respond. Our goal is to be proactively helpful and ready. First Call : You reach out to your student to schedule your first call, which is a full-time mentor call. Please send a calendar invite to the student and calendar@codingnomads.co, and the contact method you'll use to get in touch. Calendly is a useful tool to help you find a common time slot. Recurring Weekly Call : During your first call, you will schedule your standing weekly 1-on-1 call with your student. First Call \u00b6 Preparation : Before your first call, ask the students to make as much progress on the beginning sections of the course (machine setup etc.) as possible. This will make your first meeting more productive - a great way for the student to kick off! Introduction : Since this will be the first time that you and your student meet face-to-face, take 10-15 minutes to get to know them and discuss their goals and expectations for the course. Setting clear expectations as well as clearly knowing why the student is taking the course is helpful for themselves, as well as for you, in order to better keep them accountable. Screen-Sharing : Next dive right into letting them share their screen. Make sure they\u2019ve got everything installed correctly, IDE downloaded, labs open in the IDE and able to run applications and push their work to GitHub. Help them fix what might still be missing. If there is extra time, go further into using Git or getting cozy working with their IDE. Student Support Checklist CORE DUTY #1: Make Your Support Felt \u00b6 Our students need to know that you are with them and care about their progress : Reach out to them regularly to ask how things are going Stay up-to-date with their progress using their Outline Report Share an interesting link with them We want each of our mentors to make every student feel truly supported . If possible, think of your students more as friends rather than sticking to a stiff, formal student-teacher relationship. Like good friends, we want students to feel that we are here for them when they need us. Laughter and friendship go a long way in making sure the learning process is fun! Get To Know Your Student \u00b6 Use your first call to ask them about themselves. Tell them a little bit about yourself as well. Getting to know each other and exchanging personal thoughts is often nicer on a video call than in writing. We will also provide a log file with info and notes about your student. Please add a brief, ~1-2 sentence, entry to the log after every call. It helps to keep track of their progress, motivations, and concerns. The log file is a good place to document the student's goals from week-to-week. It is also helpful to work with your student to develop a rough timeline for completing their coursework. Ask them how many hours per week they are able to dedicate to the course and help them set expectations for themselves (while remaining flexible). The optimistic \"pushing hard\" timeline for most courses is to work an average of 15 hours per week and finish in 12 weeks. You can check with the course creator or experienced mentors for insight on how long it takes students to finish particular modules, or the course in general. Answer Discord Questions \u00b6 Prompt your students to post to, answer, and discuss on the CodingNomads Discord . We want to promote our Discord server as a helpful and welcoming place where students and mentors interact and share knowledge. Therefore, we welcome you to: Check Discord regularly Prompt your students to discuss questions on Discord Answer your students' questions Answer other students' questions Contribute interesting posts The more questions and answers and discussion that you and your students share in Discord, the more benefit will come to the rest of our community. Stay Up-To-Date With Your Students' Progress \u00b6 Knowing where your students are currently at, what they have succeeded to do and with what they might be struggling is important so they can feel that we care about their learning process. Our platform offers ways to stay up-to-date with your students' progress. Here are instructions on how to find your students' progress logs. How to find your student's progress log Before your call, make sure to check where your student is at. This will also help you find topics to discuss if your student doesn't have any specific questions. Code Review The Capstone Project \u00b6 Most mentored courses include at least one larger project, called the capstone project. This project makes your students put the content they are learning into practice. Your responsibility as their mentor is to support them through their work on the capstone project: Push them to keep working on it and get it done. Answer question they have, and help them with finding solutions. Code review their project code thoroughly. We suggest you to do your code reviews on GitHub , as this will additionally prepare your students for the real-world experience of receiving code reviews directly in their code on GitHub, as well as to help them practice the process associated with that. This will be the largest project your students have worked on so far, so be patient and supportive and help them to get it done. There's nothing quite as useful and motivating as having a completed project that you built by yourself :). Capstone Review Guidance \u00b6 Capstone projects should be completely new and personal. Students should not reuse old example projects or code from the course material. Each line of code should be written from scratch, with intention. They'll need to clearly demonstrate comprehension of the course material, and also the ability to stand on their own. As your student\u2019s project begins to progress, assist them in making decisions that will benefit the quality of the project. Provide constructive feedback during weekly sessions, targeting the specific feature they are currently working on. Give the student a list of tasks to accomplish before next week\u2019s session. When your student believes the project is nearing \u201ccomplete\u201d and is ready for demonstration, have them share a GitHub link. This is when you\u2019ll perform a top-to-bottom review. Take notes during each step below of any fixes or adjustments that are required. Clone the repo and follow instructions in their README to get the project running. Use each feature of the application, testing for functionality. Conduct a thorough code review of the entire project. Utilize the course-specific capstone requirements to ensure the project is up to standard: Java Programming Advanced Java & Spring Python DSML Deep Learning - UPDATE ME Flask - UPDATE ME Django - UPDATE ME Complete and submit the relevant capstone review form: Java, Python, Spring, Flask, Django DSML Provide your student with final constructive feedback based on your notes. Once the student makes additional changes based on this feedback, a second review is recommended - encourage them to post the project publicly on Discord for further community review. CORE DUTY #2: Weekly 1-On-1 Calls \u00b6 Alongside with making sure your students feel supported and taken care of during their learning process, the weekly 1-on-1 calls are what constitute your core mentorship offering. We recommend scheduling these calls for 1 hour. We encourage you, if possible, not to schedule meetings back-to-back so that a meeting can run long if needed. You\u2019re also encouraged to hop on extra calls with your students if your schedule permits and you feel like text is insufficient for answering a particular question, or that that would be the best way to get your student unstuck! Using Zoom for scheduling, video sessions, and recordings Set Weekly Goals Every Week \u00b6 This is one of the #1 pieces of feedback we get from students. They want help setting goals and they want accountability to stick to those goals. Setting realistic goals is a process that does not happen overnight. Start by setting ambitious but achievable goals for them each week and start to scale back if you see they are regularly coming up a bit short. Set A Fixed Meeting Time \u00b6 Schedule the 1-on-1 with your student at a fixed recurring time every week . Send a recurring calendar invite for your weekly meetings so it's on both your calendars. Use your first call to lock in a time slot, then stick to it. No one enjoys the back-and-forth of trying to figure out a time, and we're aware that you have more important (and more fun) things to do with your time. Help Your Students Come Prepared \u00b6 Calls will be more productive if both you and your student come prepared. To make that more likely, you can: send an email or chat message to your student one day before your call Know What To Talk About \u00b6 During your 1-on-1 call, you review their labs together and discuss their code . These labs are the content of their aforementioned submissions. \u201cGrading\u201d these submissions, therefore, happens in a live discussion with the student, rather than separate from the call. This allows students to ask specific questions and brings about a more organic discussion regarding their code. See more in Labs & Projects You will discuss challenging concepts from the course materials if the student has not quite gotten a grip on them yet. Interested students have interesting questions! Help them find the answers. You are there to help them get unstuck, and help them learn how to get unstuck by themselves (i.e., helping them to learn how to google the right questions!). Finally, you will help them create study schedules , set realistic expectations , and check in with them on their progress. You are there to hold them accountable for their plans. Help them set generous plans for themselves so that they will be able to stick to their plans. In short, during your 1-on-1 session you should : Review labs and project code together Discuss course-related concepts Answer student questions Help them schedule and stick to their plans Set Goals - they want goals and accountability Recording Video Calls \u00b6 Encourage students to screen-record your 1-on-1 calls . Having their mentor session recorded is useful for the students because then they can refer back to the video afterward. Students can thereby re-watch helpful parts of a meeting. Some students will be more relaxed during the call since they know they can always come back and check if they think they missed something. Submit Support Logs \u00b6 Any time you support your student we ask you to add a brief entry into the students log file. Weekly Mentor Standup \u00b6 Every Friday, we ask you to complete a quick form. In this form you'll check in about this week's mentorship. You can raise concerns regarding a student's progress, so we can help and intervene quickly, if necessary. Please make sure to submit this form every week : Weekly Mentor Standup Time Tracking With TopTracker \u00b6 To keep track of the time you spend on mentoring your students, please use the TopTracker time tracker. TopTracker is easy to use and makes time tracking (nearly) effortless. We will use your TopTracker-recorded time to calculate your payment each month. How to use TopTracker for CodingNomads time tracking Wrap Up Working With A Student \u00b6 When you student progresses well through the course, they will eventually reach the end and graduate. At this time, please fill out the student close-out form. Please also fill out the form in the unfortunate event that the student drops out. Progress Notifications \u00b6 So that the management team can stay up-to-date with our students' progress, we ask you to send us a couple of progress updates throughout each student's course journey: 50% Complete : Send a chat message or email to the admin team when your student is about halfway through the course. This is not an exact marker point, but an approximation. Capstone Started : Inform us when your student has started working on their capstone project (chat message or email) Capstone Reviewed : Once your student has finished their capstone project and you have reviewed and approved their code on GitHub, send us the final progress notification per chat message or email. This message should reach us before your final call with the student. Receiving this information from you is extremely important, so that we can commence the close-out process for that student. The Final Call \u00b6 After reviewing your student's capstone project code and letting us know that they have completed the course, you'll go on a final close-out call with your student. Similar to your intro call, this call will be a little different than your other 1:1s. Here are some helpful tips to keep in mind: It's The End : Clearly state to your student that the upcoming call will be your final call. This gives them a chance to revisit topics and assemble some questions that might still linger on their minds. Request Certificate : Each course includes a Google form at the end that students can submit to request their completion certificate. Encourage them to fill this form if you assess that they have put in the work and completed the course. Give Pointers : By the time your final call comes around, you will know your student's interests well, so you're encouraged to provide them with tips and suggestions on how to continue their learning journey following their interests. Ask For Satisfaction : Ask your student if there is anything we can do to make them completely satisfied with our service. We want to provide great mentorship and we want our students to be happy and satisfied. If they have feedback and wishes, let them know we'll do our best and pass on their suggestions to us. Ask For Reviews : Reviews are important to help others discover and trust our mentoring services. Ask your student to leave us a review on SwitchUp and CourseReport . They can write one and copy-paste to the other service. This is extremely helpful for getting the word out and building trust for our future students. Point To Our Community : Re-iterate that alumni of our courses are very welcome to keep asking and answering questions on Discord and our chat community. They can keep reaching out to us and other students. We would love for them to be an active part of the CodingNomads community. Please make sure to encourage your student to submit the Google form to request a certificate of completion, if you assess that they have put in the work and completed the course. Let us know over chat or email that your student is ready to graduate! \ud83c\udf89 Troubleshooting \u00b6 Check out our FAQ page . Feel free to reach out to Michael or anyone in the management team!

First Contact : We send a shared email to both you and your student, to establish the initial contact. We will also create a dedicated Discord channel for you and your mentee. After we share an introduction, please respond at your earliest convenience rather than waiting for the student to respond. Our goal is to be proactively helpful and ready. First Call : You reach out to your student to schedule your first call, which is a full-time mentor call. Please send a calendar invite to the student and calendar@codingnomads.co, and the contact method you'll use to get in touch. Calendly is a useful tool to help you find a common time slot.

This will make your first meeting more productive - a great way for the student to kick off! Introduction : Since this will be the first time that you and your student meet face-to-face, take 10-15 minutes to get to know them and discuss their goals and expectations for the course. Setting clear expectations as well as clearly knowing why the student is taking the course is helpful for themselves, as well as for you, in order to better keep them accountable. Screen-Sharing : Next dive right into letting them share their screen. Make sure they\u2019ve got everything installed correctly, IDE downloaded, labs open in the IDE and able to run applications and push their work to GitHub. Help them fix what might still be missing. If there is extra time, go further into using Git or getting cozy working with their IDE.

We will also provide a log file with info and notes about your student. Please add a brief, ~1-2 sentence, entry to the log after every call. It helps to keep track of their progress, motivations, and concerns. The log file is a good place to document the student's goals from week-to-week. It is also helpful to work with your student to develop a rough timeline for completing their coursework. Ask them how many hours per week they are able to dedicate to the course and help them set expectations for themselves (while remaining flexible). The optimistic \"pushing hard\" timeline for most courses is to work an average of 15 hours per week and finish in 12 weeks.

Answer question they have, and help them with finding solutions. Code review their project code thoroughly. We suggest you to do your code reviews on GitHub , as this will additionally prepare your students for the real-world experience of receiving code reviews directly in their code on GitHub, as well as to help them practice the process associated with that.

As your student\u2019s project begins to progress, assist them in making decisions that will benefit the quality of the project. Provide constructive feedback during weekly sessions, targeting the specific feature they are currently working on. Give the student a list of tasks to accomplish before next week\u2019s session.

Here are some helpful tips to keep in mind: It's The End : Clearly state to your student that the upcoming call will be your final call. This gives them a chance to revisit topics and assemble some questions that might still linger on their minds. Request Certificate : Each course includes a Google form at the end that students can submit to request their completion certificate. Encourage them to fill this form if you assess that they have put in the work and completed the course. Give Pointers : By the time your final call comes around, you will know your student's interests well, so you're encouraged to provide them with tips and suggestions on how to continue their learning journey following their interests. Ask For Satisfaction : Ask your student if there is anything we can do to make them completely satisfied with our service. We want to provide great mentorship and we want our students to be happy and satisfied. If they have feedback and wishes, let them know we'll do our best and pass on their suggestions to us. Ask For Reviews : Reviews are important to help others discover and trust our mentoring services. Ask your student to leave us a review on SwitchUp and CourseReport . They can write one and copy-paste to the other service. This is extremely helpful for getting the word out and building trust for our future students. Point To Our Community : Re-iterate that alumni of our courses are very welcome to keep asking and answering questions on Discord and our chat community. They can keep reaching out to us and other students. We would love for them to be an active part of the CodingNomads community.

These notes are suggestions that you can pick from in order to improve your work as a mentor. It is also meant to be a living document, so please feel free to add sections that you find helpful in order to spread your insights to the rest of our mentor community. How To Be A Great Mentor Know Your Student Be Their Guide Let Them Teach Encourage Study Groups Have A Plan Encourage Student Peer Reviews Do Mentor Peer Reviews Do Code Reviews Check For Code Repository Updates Know Your Student \u00b6 Keeping a solid overview who each of your students are, what their aims are, and how they are progressing, is essential in knowing how to help them best. Progress: Keep track of your student's progress! Use the platform for help. Notes: Take notes after calls. You can make a copy of this pre-set doc . If you make it a habit to take notes and check up on each student's progress, you'll be in a much better position to help them in their learning process. Be Their Guide \u00b6 Explain to your students that you are here as a guide . You cannot fill knowledge into their heads, and you won't be with them all the time. However, you are there to help them navigate through the learning maze. Help them take the right turns, and make it easier for them to see the path they need to walk and assist them in taking the necessary steps. Let Them Teach \u00b6 You can explain a concept to your mentee, if they don't yet have it all figured out. Next time you see someone ask the same question e.g. on Discord, try to give your first mentee a chance to explain it to the next person ! Send them a link, remind them that you went over this together, and ask them to answer the question for the other student. Explaining a concept to someone else is a very effective learning tool. Encourage Study Groups \u00b6 Study groups are awesome! They bring great results for learners. However, it is hard to make productive study groups work well remotely. Therefore, most of the time your mentee will learn by themselves. If you see an opportunity to make their learning more social, e.g. by connecting them with one of your other mentees when they are working on a similar challenge, do it! Please feel free to facilitate and encourage such connections between students . Have A Plan \u00b6 It's easy to procrastinate if you don't have a plan. One of your tasks is to make it as easy as possible for your mentees to have a clear and actionable plan that is scheduled on their own calendar. Students need to: Know what they are expected to do very clearly Have a time plan on when they will work on it Understand when they'll want to have it done Have accountability for their plans and their workload As a mentor, you can be a great help with helping them to set up a study plan, make sure that it is realistic so they won't get frustrated by constantly not meeting their aims, have your students assign time slots on their calendars, and finally also provide accountability by checking back with them to see whether they are sticking to the plan. Explain to them that they can split themselves into two personalities for getting things done: The benevolent planner The diligent executioner During planning, you need to keep your own best interests in mind. How much time can I really set aside for this, and when? How much can I really get done during a time slot? Suggest them to set their time slots and goals according to a benevolent plan that they create for themselves. This is important for the second phase, execution. If you set yourself up for a productive and motivating time during your planning session, then it'll be much easier to sit down as planned and simply execute. Not having to worry about whether the thing you're doing right now is the best use of your time makes for much more productive work sessions. Encourage Student Peer Reviews \u00b6 Learning through teaching is a thing, and we want our students to learn as effectively as possible. If you can, and if they agree to it, give your students a chance to look at each other's work and do peer reviews of each other's code. This is a great learning opportunity for both of your students. Your role is to make sure they do the peer reviews in a respectful, correct, and productive way. Do Mentor Peer Reviews \u00b6 Show your work to other mentors. Allow them to learn from you and learn from them and their feedback. Small circles of people that have a strong interest in something and stick together to openly, constructively, criticize each other, that's how specialized groups of people develop. It would be awesome if we together developed ourselves as an elite group of awesome programing mentors that are close to each other, highly skilled, and super effective in teaching students to code. Do Code Reviews \u00b6 We're currently using GitHub in-line comments for code review. This gets students more familiar with additional functionality in GitHub and makes it easy for us to provide well-formatted and on-the-spot feedback. If you are not familiar with giving code reviews in GitHub, check out our Guide on giving GitHub Reviews . Difficulties : There are some downsides to this process. E.g. it's difficult to code review for students who commit code often because a piece of code you are providing feedback on might not be the most recent version. What helps with this is to always start at doing your code review on the latest commit. Logical Commits : Generally, advise your students to commit logical pieces of work, e.g. when they finished one lab, or when they finished the labs for one full section of the course. This is a good practice for software development anyways, and helps them get used to working in that way early on. Pull Requests : If your students are more experienced working with GitHub, you can also suggest them to create Pull Requests. PRs squash multiple commits and you can do a proper code review on the changes introduced through the PR, which is optimal for everyone's convenience, as well as closest to real-life software development and code review processes. Check For Code Repository Updates \u00b6 Students should have easy access to code examples and exercises. We host our code on GitHub. Labs and example code are provided in a well-structured repository that students can download and push to their own GitHub. Students should also set up a second remote that is pointing to the original repo. We will keep the original repo up-to-date, e.g. with feedback received from you and your students. Students can then pull updates from that second remote. Encourage your students to set up that second remote and check up on whether there were any updates in the original repository every once in a while.","title":"Philosophy"},{"location":"04_how_to_mentor/#how-to-be-a-great-mentor","text":"This document contains tips and ideas gathered from experience working with students both online and in person.

If you are not familiar with giving code reviews in GitHub, check out our Guide on giving GitHub Reviews . Difficulties : There are some downsides to this process. E.g. it's difficult to code review for students who commit code often because a piece of code you are providing feedback on might not be the most recent version. What helps with this is to always start at doing your code review on the latest commit. Logical Commits : Generally, advise your students to commit logical pieces of work, e.g. when they finished one lab, or when they finished the labs for one full section of the course. This is a good practice for software development anyways, and helps them get used to working in that way early on. Pull Requests : If your students are more experienced working with GitHub, you can also suggest them to create Pull Requests. PRs squash multiple commits and you can do a proper code review on the changes introduced through the PR, which is optimal for everyone's convenience, as well as closest to real-life software development and code review processes.","title":"Do Code Reviews"},{"location":"04_how_to_mentor/#check-for-code-repository-updates","text":"Students should have easy access to code examples and exercises. We host our code on GitHub. Labs and example code are provided in a well-structured repository that students can download and push to their own GitHub. Students should also set up a second remote that is pointing to the original repo. We will keep the original repo up-to-date, e.g. with feedback received from you and your students. Students can then pull updates from that second remote. Encourage your students to set up that second remote and check up on whether there were any updates in the original repository every once in a while.","title":"Check For Code Repository Updates"},{"location":"05_tools/","text":"Tools for CodingNomads Mentors \u00b6 This page contains a collection of quick how-to guides for using the necessary tools to be an effective CodingNomads Mentor. It starts with a list of the absolutely essential tools, then describes how to use them in more detail. Tools for CodingNomads Mentors Essential Software Time Tracking With TopTracker Set Up TopTracker Track Mentorship Time Community Support Project Wait, but what if I forget turn on my tracker?! Or, even worse, forget to turn it off!?! Generate and Submit Your Invoices Scheduling With Google Calendar Booking Meetings With Calendly Recording Meetings On Google Calendar Video Sessions and Communication With Discord Set Up Discord Server Roles Channels Mentor Support and Sessions Progress Check-Ins With The Learning Platform Code Reviews With GitHub Student Communication Templates Other Useful Tools Worldtimebuddy Doodle There Essential Software \u00b6 You'll need these tools in order to be able to mentor a CodingNomads student: TopTracker Google Calendar Discord Learning Platform GitHub Please make sure to install these programs and request access where necessary. You'll find more detailed descriptions in the dedicated sections. Time Tracking With TopTracker \u00b6 Please use TopTracker to record your time spent mentoring. https://tracker.toptal.com/ Set Up TopTracker \u00b6 To get started, please follow these steps: Sign up for a free account by clicking Get Started as a Freelancer . You can click \"NO\" on any TopTracker setup questions such as \"allow screenshots\" and \"track mouse clicks\" or anything weird like that. We do not use those features. Notify Jared (or Ryan) to add you to the Onboarding project. You'll receive an invitation from admin@codingnomads.co to join the project called Onboarding as a Freelancer . Track the time you spend on onboarding under that project. You can also add manual time entries, for the time you tracked before we managed to invite you to the project. Download TopTracker for Desktop , if you prefer to track your time in a dedicated app. Skip Payoneer Setup: We don't use Payoneer for payment. You can skip that section while setting up your TopTracker account. Track Mentorship Time \u00b6 Once you've started working with a student, we will set up a Project with your student's name and invite you as a Freelancer . From then on, you'll track the time you spend mentoring this student in their dedicated project. If you are working with multiple students, make sure to record your time for each student in the correct project. To minimize your effort, when logging time to a student project, you can limit your tracking entries to keywords such as: call discord code review etc Watch the screencast below, which shows you how mentorship time tracking with TopTracker works in practice: Please follow this workflow to keep track of the time you spend working with your student. Your compensation is based on the recorded time, and the invoices you generate (see next step). Community Support Project \u00b6 We will also invite you to the Community Support project. This ToppTracker project can be used to answer questions on Discord including the general community support Discord channels (i.e., helping students for which you don\u2019t have a specific project). You are encouraged to answer any and all questions that are posted by any CodingNomads student on any community channel within CodingNomads\u2019 Discord server. All CodingNomads mentors are permitted to bill for up to two (2) hours per week for answering general student questions and supporting students on any community Discord channel or thread. However, mentors are not permitted to bill for community support on private 1-on-1 channels. Billable community support must be visible to the community. Private 1-on-1 channels are only billable by mentors when working with a student assigned by CodingNomads. If you would like to extend the weekly maximum of two (2) billable hours for general community Discord support, this will need to be previously agreed upon in writing by both you and CodingNomads. When charging to the community support project, please put both a keyword (from the list above) and a specific description in the TopTracker activity description. For example: \u201cDiscord: supporting Tiffany, connecting to databases, general JDBC\u201d. Wait, but what if I forget turn on my tracker?! Or, even worse, forget to turn it off!?! \u00b6 On its web application, in the \"my activities\" tab, TopTracker allows you to manually add, edit, or delete time. Generate and Submit Your Invoices \u00b6 On the first day of each month, please submit an invoice for each of your TopTracker projects for the previous month. Please see the screenshot below for this process, and refer to the Monthly Payment Process for more details about invoicing and payments. Click Invoices tab on the left Click the green button called Create Invoice in the top right Select the project you want to invoice for Adjust dates to the first and last day of the previous month Click Save Draft and Preview in the bottom right Click Send Invoice You need to submit a separate invoice for each of your students. Please submit all invoices each month in order to get paid. Scheduling With Google Calendar \u00b6 You'll use Google Calendar for scheduling your student calls. If you don't have a Google account, please sign up for one . Booking Meetings With Calendly \u00b6 To make life easier for you, you can use Calendly . It's a handy tool that allows you to block out your availability and let students book meeting times with you through a shareable link. Using their free tier, you can specify the times you are available for meetings, then send your student a link where they can choose a time that works for them. Calendly can significantly reduce the effort needed to find a time that works for both you and your students. It also integrates with Google Calendar. Recording Meetings On Google Calendar \u00b6 Every student meeting you have needs to be recorded on our CN Scheduling Calendar at calendar@codingnomads.co . We use this information to keep track of student's meetings and how far along they are in their subscription. This means you need to: include the student and mentor names in the event title - for example \"Ryan & Michael\" invite calendar@codingnomads.co to every student meeting update any changes to your student meetings on these shared calendar events Sometimes, students will need to cancel or move a meeting. Make sure to update the calendar by moving or deleting the meeting. We can only guarantee payment for meetings that show up on this calendar. You will also be invited to a calendar invite that represents the student's last week at CodingNomads. If you and your student decide not to meet one week, please update the calendar to add a week to the student's program. For example, if your student requests a week off for christmas (encouraged!), and their last date is January 1st, then update the calendar to show that their last date is now January 8th. If there is any confusion on this topic, please ask Jared or Michael. Video Sessions and Communication With Discord \u00b6 Discord includes screen-sharing capabilities that can be used for 1-on-1 sessions with students. Google Meet is our recommended alternative in case a student would like to record sessions. Set Up Discord \u00b6 Before proceeding, please reference the Discord Guide for Members to get an idea of what the Discord experience looks like for subscribing members. The process of joining the server is the same for mentors. The difference is that shortly after joining, roles will be added to your profile that unlock additional channels and abilities on the server. Server Roles \u00b6 Permissions on the server are moderated using roles. All users who have been verified for access are assigned the Member role. Roles are then \"stacked\", adding additional permissions to a user. For example: Subscribing members (self-study): Member Mentored students: Member + Mentored Mentors: Member + Mentor Mentor/Moderators: Member + Mentor + Moderator Username color on the server is dictated by their \"highest ranking\" role. Mentors can easily be identified by the yellow color of their name. Members and Mentored students are represented by slightly different shades of blue. There are also a collection of \"interest roles\" that can be applied to your profile by visiting the #interest-management channel. We ask mentors to add all topics they can assist with to their profile. Channels \u00b6 Please take the time to visit the #introduce-yourself channel and share a short bio message with the community. Let everyone know you are human! Support channels are broken down into two categories. Your focus as a mentor will be on the channels within the MENTORED SUPPORT category. These channels are only accessible by mentored students, and should be actively monitored by all mentors who have the ability to assist. For example, if you are a Java mentor, you should right-click the #Java channel (in the MENTORED SUPPORT category) and under Notification Settings -> Select All . You can also right-click the CodingNomads server icon on the left and click Notification Settings for a dialog with additional options. Here you can quickly set up notification overrides for individual channels or entire categories. The #general_... support channels (within the community support category) are community supported. This is where you can bill up to 2 hours per week for community support. Admin staff will also often lend a hand to help members here. The way Discord handles direct messages between two individuals is different than Slack. If you message a user on Discord, you are taken out of the server, in to your private messaging area. This means that server nicknames or server profiles no longer apply. If you are \"Sam Smith\" on the CodingNomads server, but your username is \"smoothcriminal5000\", the student is suddenly communicating with smoothcriminal5000 . Not a professional look. This goes both ways as well, all of the sudden you have to keep track of your student's real name, and username (which may not be pretty). To avoid this situation, all mentors will require two dedicated channels for each of their actively mentored students - a Text channel and a Voice channel. The format should always be consistent: #firstname-lastname And if you are Sam Smith, these channels will be located within a category titled: SAM'S STUDENTS or SAM'S MENTEES This way, all direct communication between you and your students remains inside the CodingNomads server and will not impede on your personal message space. This configuration also comes with the added benefit of allowing custom notification settings for each student. These channels will be created for you automatically when paired with a student. Please keep your communications with your students to these channels, as well as the community channels within CodingNomads. Mentor Support and Sessions \u00b6 Your student's dedicated text channel is the primary space for direct support. Encourage students to reach out often, assured that you will respond at your earliest convenience. For times when you will be unavailable for an extended period, point students to the MENTORED SUPPORT category channels for support. That way, other mentors can step in to help. Voice channels in Discord have built-in screen sharing capabilities. This allows mentors and students to quickly and easily connect for recurring and impromptu support sessions. Once you and your student both join the dedicated voice channel, you can start chatting right away. When the student is ready to share their screen, they can simply click one of two \"Share Your Screen\" buttons. From there, they can choose to share a single window (Applications), or the entire screen (Screens). After clicking Go Live , please set the quality selector to Better Text Readability for the best experience. Please guide your student through these steps as well. If you or your student have trouble sharing - black screen, constant loading, etc. it has been found that disabling the following Discord setting can help: Settings -> Voice & Video -> Open H264 Video Codec provided by Cisco Systems, Inc. -> Disable As mentioned, we recommend sticking to the audio channels in Discord for 1-on-1 sessions with your students. However, if your student would like to record their 1-on-1 sessions, or either party is having any difficulty with meeting over Discord, we recommend using Google Meet as an alternative. Progress Check-Ins With The Learning Platform \u00b6 You'll need to keep track of how your student is progressing through the course materials in order to give them actionable feedback and help them keep moving. Make sure that you have an active account on the CodingNomads learning platform . After you've completed onboarding, you'll get upgraded to the role of Mentor to be able to access everything. If you need that access and don't have it yet, please contact . To find your students' progress logs , follow these steps: Log into codingnomads.com Click on your user avatar image in the top right corner Click on \"Mentor Portal\" Under \"current students\", click on the students name Next, you will see all courses for which the student has a progress of > 0 - click on the appropriate course and scroll Note: This is also where you will be writing support logs for mentored students Code Reviews With GitHub \u00b6 We use GitHub inline comments for code reviews. If you are not familiar with giving code reviews in GitHub, check out our Guide on giving GitHub Reviews . Student Communication Templates \u00b6 You can set communication snippets up as Gmail templates or copy-paste the content from the resource linked below. Please replace the fields marked with {ALL_CAPS} . Feel free to personalize as much as you want to. These templates are meant to make it quicker for you to get started communicating with your students, but personal communication is priceless for good mentorship results. Student Communication Templates Please add any relevant repeating communications that you create so that other mentors can benefit from it, or let us know when you think that something is missing. Other Useful Tools \u00b6 The following tools have been useful for some mentors. You can include them in your workflow if they seem helpful for you. Worldtimebuddy \u00b6 A great tool for scheduling across multiple time zones. I use this all the time. https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/ Doodle \u00b6 Helpful for remotely deciding for a call time, especially when there are many people involved. Can also be helpful for scheduling your first orientation call with your student. https://doodle.com/create However, setting up your Calendly account is probably more convenient and easier to handle. There \u00b6 A MacOS app that helps keeping track of all your students' current times across multiple time zones. Nicely integrated in OS X and helps to quickly check up on whether someone's up or sleeping. https://there.pm/","title":"Tools"},{"location":"05_tools/#tools-for-codingnomads-mentors","text":"This page contains a collection of quick how-to guides for using the necessary tools to be an effective CodingNomads Mentor.

Generally you can find your US tax treaty information online, or consult your tax professional if you have questions. This form does not get submitted to the IRS, rather it's a form CodingNomads keeps on file in the case that we get audited to explain why we do not withhold 30% of your paycheck for US taxes.

Monthly Payment Process \u00b6 On the first day of each month, please go into your TopTracker Invoices section, then create and submit an invoice for each of your projects for the previous month: We will process invoices two times at the beginning of each month: If you submit your invoices by the 1st, you'll get paid by the 10th or sooner. If you submit by the 10th, you'll get paid by the 15th. For example, for the hours you invoiced from December, you will be paid by January 15.

Please help us keep this process efficient by remembering to submit your invoices, so we can pay you faster! Ultimately it is up to you to submit your invoices on time to get paid on time. Please keep the following in mind: Time Tracking: Since you are keeping time in TopTracker and we have access to these time entries, you don't need to send us anything additional once we have your payment details - just the monthly invoice generated for each project.

How Closely Should I Monitor My Students' Progress? How Many Students Will I Mentor? \u00b6 We want to be able to invest in you and make you part of our mentor community. Therefore, we aim for a minimum of 3 students per mentor. There's currently no maximum number of students you can take on, as long as it fits in your schedule and you can provide the high quality and allotted time commitment that we expect. If you're thinking of taking on more than 10 students, please get in contact so we can better understand your situation and motivations. Who To Contact Regarding Payment? \u00b6 Write an email to . Who To Contact Regarding General Mentorship Questions? \u00b6 Write an email to or ping @Michael on Discord. What if I forget turn on my tracker?! Or, even worse, forget to turn it off? \u00b6 On its web application, in the \"my activities\" tab, TopTracker allows you to manually add, edit, or delete time. My Student Wants To Reschedule A Meeting \u00b6 If a student needs to reschedule one of their meetings and does so with adequate notice (12 hours or more), we'd encourage you to find a new time with them. Life can get in the way, and as long as this is an exception, and you can manage to make time in your own schedule, we want to support students to have their mentor sessions. We hope, and expect reschedules to be rare. You have no obligation to reschedule any meeting with the student if it happens outside of the agreed-upon time slot. We understand that you have other work to do, and we want to set clear examples to avoid time spent on scheduling wherever possible. If you do want to reschedule, it is at your own discretion to do so. If rescheduling happens often , please let the student know that they should find a different time slot for your 1-on-1 call. Also, please inform Michael at . My Student Didn't Show For A Scheduled 1-On-1 Call \u00b6 Your meeting time slot should be on a fixed time every week . If a student does not show up for your meeting and doesn't contact you more than 12 hours ahead of the scheduled time, this will be considered a no-show . If you haven't heard from your student until the meeting time, please wait for 10 minutes to see whether they are just late, then cancel the call. Record the no-show in your Session Report. You may charge 50% of the scheduled call time in the event of a no-show. This also applies if the student cancels within 12 hours of a shceduled meeting. Record the 50% time in your TopTracker activities and make sure to mention it was a no-show in your Session Report. Please clearly communicate to your students that we aim for a professional environment , which means, in this case, to stick to scheduled meetings as much as possible, and give at least 24 hours notice if they need to cancel. After a no-show, please make sure to check in with the student and get confirmation that they\u2019ll attend the next meeting. Please contact Michael if: -you don\u2019t hear from the student for a week after the no-show, -if they don\u2019t show up for two weeks in a row (despite confirming their expected attendance). My Student Has Not Responded For Several Days \u00b6 Some students need a tad more encouragement than others. Please attempt to get and stay in contact with your mentee even if they seem unresponsive. Ask them if there's any way you can help (coding-related or maybe with time management tips), send encouraging words, an interesting link or a funny coding-related meme. However, if you haven't heard back from your mentee in more than a week, please reach out to . The Website Says Students Get Unlimited Support - How Much Time Should I Invest? \u00b6 This means that students are not limited to just their one weekly call. If they want, they can ask questions any time to their mentor on Discord or, if they'd like a potentially quicker answer, the public chat channels. Few students go over the 1.5, occasionally 2, hours of direct 1-on-1 mentorship per week. Most students stay below it. So if there are a few students here and there that are really soaking up your mentor time, then it's okay because they can basically absorb the mentorship time that we have allotted and budgeted for other students, but that those other students haven't used. We tell our potential students that they have one scheduled call per week, but that they are highly encouraged to reach out anytime they are stuck or have a question. We tell them that anyone of our mentors will get back to them ASAP. And this is unlimited. We used to do two calls per week but most students ended up cancelling the second call. If you feel the student has a question that would be easier to answer on a call, and you have time, feel free to offer to hop on an extra call. How Closely Should I Monitor My Students' Progress? \u00b6 Stay up-to-date with what they're working on, it'll make your 1:1 call more effective and your support more actionable for the student. Use the Outline Report provided in our platform to help with that. You can also set up an agreement with your student that they check in with you every day in a stand-up fashion and send you a quick message on: what are they currently working on? what are they stuck on, if anything? what are their plans for today? Also, ask them to share their GitHub account with you. You can subscribe to be notified when they push updates, which makes it easier for you to keep track of their progress with the labs. Being up-to-date with your students' progress helps to build an understanding of their knowledge and blind spots.","title":"FAQs"},{"location":"09_faq/#frequently-asked-questions-faqs","text":"Quick and searchable answers for common questions.

I'm excited to be working with you. I'll send along some scheduling information shortly so that we can set up our first meeting. If you'd like, we'd love for you to post an introduction about yourself on the Introductions thread on [Discord](https://codingnomads.com/discord) Looking forward to meeting you :) Intro Follow-up Email \u00b6 Hi again `{STUDENT_NAME}`, I sent you a Discord message with this same info, and I want to email it too to make sure it reaches you. Let's try to keep our conversations in Discord moving forward. Discord is designed for conversation, and it's easier to keep our communication in one place. Sorry for the duplicate info if you already saw this on Discord :) I'm hoping to set up a call with you for this week so that we can get to know each other and touch base on learning methods, priorities, goals, etc., as we'll make sure that you're all set up and ready to get started. I'm currently in `{MENTOR_LOCATION}`, so my time zone is `{MENTOR_TIMEZONE}`. You're currently in `{STUDENT_LOCATION}`, right? Let me know which times work best regarding your schedule. I put the times that will work best for me for our first call in this scheduling tool linked below. Please vote on the listed time that works best for you. If you don't see a time that works for you, please write back and we'll figure something else out: `{SCHEDULING_LINK}` This meeting time is primarily for our first call, but if it works well, we can use the same time slot for our recurring meeting times moving forward, too. Looking forward to hearing from you, `{MENTOR_NAME}` CodingNomads Discord Response And Prompt \u00b6 Hi `{STUDENT_NAME}`! Great to hear from you! :) You're welcome to contact me here on Discord any time, and you can also use the `{COURSE_CHANNEL}` channel for any course and content-related thoughts. You can also use any other channel here that makes sense to you! When you get the time, please write a quick intro on [Discor](https://codingnomads.com/discord) Discord is a great resource for searching for, asking, discussing, and answering questions - talking about code essentially! Glad to have you on board and let me know if you need anything. First Call Follow-Up \u00b6 Hi `{STUDENT_NAME}`, Nice to meet you today! I'll post the recording from our call shortly in the Google Photos album that I shared with you. You'll always be able to re-watch our calls there. I'll also be sending you an invite for our call for next week at the time we discussed. As you go through coursework or other programming related projects, I hope you'll find a couple of opportunities to fill out this little questionnaire. Filling this out is primarily for the practice of stepping back when encountering challenging programming tasks. What you come up with is mostly for you, but if it ends up being helpful and you'd like to go over some results during an upcoming call, please mention it and we can talk about it more. **Stepping back when a problem feels challenging at first glance** **Fill out the following 2 questions before attempting the challenge:** 1. What is the assignment or question? 2. What do you feel you don't know about it, or which parts do you predict will be challenging? **Fill out the next three questions after and during your attempt:** 3. Did you manage to figure it out? 4. Did the things you listed in question num. 2 end up being relevant to the assignment? If so, did they end up being difficult aspects of the assignment? 5. (If any) What resources did you use when working on the assignment? Please take note of ones that were helpful, and feel free to specify if any resources were particularly unhelpful... Attempt this exercise a couple of times. Copy paste it into a file, and jot down some notes to answer each question.

Our weekly call is coming up, and I want to make sure that you'll take the most from the time we have together. It helps to get us both prepared and focused, if you **fill the following questionnaire** each week before our call, and **send it to me**: - I'm currently in section\u2026 - Questions I want to talk about: - I'm currently stuck with\u2026 - I've tried to solve this challenge by doing the following (links to code repo, orum posts, relevant StackOverflow resources etc. are very welcome!): - When will I code during the upcoming week? - Something interesting or cool I've learned or discovered: - Other topics I want to talk about: Thanks, And looking forward to talking soon! `{MENTOR_NAME}` Prompt To Stick With Weekly Meetings \u00b6 Hi `{STUDENT_NAME}`! Hope it's been going well for you. You mentioned you'd like to cancel this week's call. I just wanted to suggest you to try to be as consistent as possible with the calls. It really helps to think of it as a weekly institution - even if you haven\u2019t made too much progress. We can always talk over some older piece of code, or ask me to give you some quick thoughts or preview the material together. Sticking to that routine, that you know you\u2019ll have your call every week, helps with staying on track. It really does! : ) That\u2019s why it helps to find a good time that\u2019ll very likely work for you every week - and then we just keep at it! Hope that makes sense, let me know if you have any questions. I'm just trying to make it the most effective for you - and we\u2019ve learned that the regular calls really do help. :) Twitter Accounts To Suggest \u00b6 One of your tasks as a mentor is to get your students involved in the programming community.

They are using Linux, so they've stumbled into a couple of issues. We installed Discord together, as well as git, and cloned the repo so they can begin to work on the labs. They haven't had much time because of a big project at work but said it's done now and as of tomorrow will have more time to focus fully on the course. They are self-taught with SQL and worked as a data analyst before. It's clear that they know how to google and are motivated to work through stuff. They were a bit worried there'd be too much reading for their taste, but I explained about the labs and projects and that I'm happy to provide more project ideas and links to make it even more practical. That seemed to resound well with them. ### 2024-01-09 They skimmed over the exercises and completed some that they didn't know so well yet (File I/O etc.). I introduced code reviews, both that I can do them if they submit links, as well as that I'll want students to do it for each other on Discord, if possible. They are originally from Veenendaal, which is fun for me because I spent two weeks there working with a friend on a startup idea. They've been working on a Django project before (a course platform, essentially) and they'll keep doing that while brushing up on the topics covered in our course. I introduced that it's very useful that they know something already, and that they'll be able to learn a lot through teaching others on Discord. They're looking forward to the interactions and discussions.

It\u2019s first and foremost the human contact that creates and upkeeps motivation. Encourage your students to meet regularly! You can use a template to prompt to stick with weekly meetings . Find a time that works for them, and stick to it. Social accountability is motivating for humans! Teach And Learn Through Code Reviews \u00b6 GitHub allows you to create in-line code comments in commits. Giving and getting code reviews is a great way to improve your coding skills. It trains you to: read and understand other people's code learn about different solutions to a task formulate your thoughts in relation to code give constructive feedback , and learn from receiving it Below, you'll find more information about how we suggest to do code reviews on GitHub, and what to focus on. Code Review Guidelines \u00b6 Be Nice : When you give a code review to a student, be nice! No one benefits from a nasty review. Give Directions : As with mentorship in general, avoid giving solutions directly. Find the solution yourself, then give the other person hints so they can figure it out on their own. We learn the most by figuring something out ourselves. Use Markdown : Readability helps. Use Markdown to make your comment nicely formatted. And you can use emojis, too. Types Of Code Review Comments \u00b6 Suggestions : Suggest improvements if you find something that's incorrect or could be improved. Congratulations : Give positive feedback if there's something you liked or found interesting. Challenges : Introduce challenges if you see that someone is onto something and might benefit from a nudge into a specific direction. Examples [TODO] \u00b6 Here are some examples of code reviews from the on-site course part. Read over them to get an idea of how to give code reviews. Do Code Reviews On GitHub \u00b6 Every time your student commits code and pushes it to GitHub, it will be available for other people to comment on. Use the great in-line code comment functionality on GitHub commits to facilitate learning and get your students used to the idea of code reviews. Go over how to create and interact with GitHub code comments together with your student on a call. Add Code Comments On GitHub \u00b6 Here's a step-by-step walk-through for adding a comment to a GitHub commit: Go to your student's GitHub account, choose the right repository and navigate to their commits: You will see a page similar to the following screenshot. Once there, click on a single commit (you can do this for every commit!). This steps you into the code that was added/changed/deleted during that specific commit: Inside of a commit's page, you'll see code lines, some of them green and red. The view is split up on a per file basis and you can easily comment directly in a specific line by clicking on the blue plus that appears when hovering over a line: Clicking it opens up a comment box, like so: Type your code comment into this box.

Cancellation Policy \u00b6 Students may cancel their subscription any time through their user profile at https://codingnomads.com/profile . If a student pre-paid for a multi-month Bootcamp / Mentorship program, they may request a refund for the months paid for after the current month when the cancellation was made. Students are not eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the fee paid for the then-current monthly period. Partial fees for partial mentorship on a weekly basis are not permitted. Cancellation for Bootcamp / Mentorship programs must be made in writing to CodingNomads via admin@codingnomads.com. All refunds will be made within 60 days of the cancellation date. The student is responsible for any bank charges or fees involved with cancellation. Mentor Meeting Cancellations and Program Extensions \u00b6 Program Extension Requests \u00b6 If students would like to request a program end-date extension for meeting reschedules or pauses, they must submit a Program Extension Request Form to be approved by CodingNomads. Meeting Cancellations \u00b6 A Meeting Cancellation refers to when a student cancels or otherwise misses a scheduled mentor meeting, and does not request a reschedule or program extension. Students have the right to cancel a mentor meeting at any time, and are not obligated to reschedule or request a program extension. We kindly ask that you notify your mentor at least 24 hours in advance of a cancellation. If a student does not provide 24 hour advance written notice before missing a scheduled mentor meeting, the meeting is considered canceled, cannot be rescheduled, and does not extend the program. Meeting Reschedules \u00b6 Students may request to reschedule a mentor meeting by sending written notice to the mentor at least 24 hours in advance of the scheduled meeting. Meeting Reschedules are subject to mentor availability, and are not guaranteed. When it is not possible to reschedule a meeting within the same calendar week, students may request a one (1) week program extension by submitting the Program Extension Request Form. Students may request to reschedule up to two (2) mentor meetings per calendar month. If a student does not provide 24-hour advance written notice, the meeting cannot be rescheduled, and the program end date cannot be extended.

Students who are enrolled in the mentorship program may request to pause their program on a single occasion for a maximum of 4 weeks. Any pause lasting more than 2 weeks may require a new assignment of mentor. Students may request that billing be paused for the duration of the pause, however, no such grant is guaranteed. Students must complete the Program Extension Request Form to be granted an end-date extension and / or billing pause during this pause. The easiest way to effectively pause a program is to withdraw from the month-to-month mentorship program and start again when ready.","title":"Cancellation Policy"},{"location":"15_cancellation_policy/#cn3-cancellation-policy","text":"Included in CodingNomads' Terms of Service. https://codingnomads.com/terms-of-service section 31.","title":"CN3 Cancellation Policy"},{"location":"15_cancellation_policy/#cancellation-policy","text":"Students may cancel their subscription any time through their user profile at https://codingnomads.com/profile .
