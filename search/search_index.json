Happy that you are interested in becoming a mentor for CodingNomads. This document describes our ideas about mentorship, and what we'd like our ideal mentor to be like. Please read this document carefully. If you have questions write to . Requirements to Become a CodingNomads Mentor CodingNomads Mentor Guidelines What does mentorship mean to us? What we don't do Whom do we want to work with? CodingNomads Mentor Guidelines \u00b6 What does mentorship mean to us? \u00b6 Mentorship at CodingNomads means that we care for our students as the individual person they are and that we try our best to assist them in their learning process. Think of yourself as a knowledgeable learning buddy to your student. Your mentee should feel comfortable contacting you when they need you. As a great mentor, you know the course material well and you know how to efficiently find solutions which you don't yet have. One important lesson is to help your students to learn how to figure challenges out by themselves. That means that you will already know the answer, but you don't tell the solution to your student directly. Instead, when and where possible, you guide them on the path of figuring it out themselves. As a mentor, you know that it's ultimately the student's effort that makes the difference whether they will learn a lot or only a little. However, you also know that there is so much you can do to make it easier for your mentees to sit down and take that necessary effort. Check in with your students frequently, make them understand that you care for their learning process and that you are available to help. Be polite, positive, fun, and encouraging - and help your students with creating learning plans and sticking to them. Get to know your students, be compassionate, and try your best to improve the learning process for each individual student that you are working with. In a nutshell, mentorship at CodingNomads is all about caring. When a student knows that they have a mentor who cares about their learning and their progress, it's a game changer. At CodingNomads, we want our mentors to be game changers. Mentor Tips What we don't do \u00b6 We never make our students feel insecure about not knowing something. We don't discriminate anyone due to anything. We're all humans here, let's be nice to each other. Whom do we want to work with? \u00b6 We want to work with mentors who know their topics and enjoy helping others learn . If you want to mentor e.g. for our Python course, you should know Python well. If you want to mentor for Java, you should know Java. The course that you are mentoring for should be a learning experience for our students, not for you. That said, we care a lot about professional development and want to give you opportunities to grow as well. As an example, mentors who have worked with us for a period of time will have the opportunity to take any of our courses free of charge with a dedicated mentor. We are currently developing this program and will provide more information on that soon. We also want to work with mentors who are interested in learning and education, who want to improve their own capacities as programmers and educators. We want people who are excited to give their input and suggestions to us and their fellow mentors, as well as learn from our students and mentor community. We want to work with people who are motivated to help with improving our service.","title":"Requirements"},{"location":"01_requirements/#requirements-to-become-a-codingnomads-mentor","text":"Welcome!

CodingNomads Mentorship Process Starting to work with a student Orientation Call CORE DUTY #1: Making your support felt Get to know your student Stay up-to-date with your students' progress Student submissions and grading CORE DUTY #2: Weekly 1-on-1 calls Set a fixed meeting time What to talk about? Record your video sessions Session Reports Time tracking with Toggl Troubleshooting Mentor support and questions Starting to work with a student \u00b6 After you've become a part of our Mentor Community, we will want to connect you with students. This happens as follows: We reach out to you to see if you're available to take on a new student When you accept, we send you the student's background info You reach out to your new mentee in order to schedule an orientation call. Please send a calendar invite and the contact method you'll use to get in touch. \\ If you want, you can use Doodle to find a common time slot. We use Zoom to record all meetings for the student and our records. Here's info on Using Zoom for scheduling, video sessions, and recordings . During your orientation call, you will schedule your standing weekly 1-on-1 call Orientation Call \u00b6 This will be the first time that you and your mentee meet. Take some time to get to know them and discuss their goals and expectations for the course. Setting clear expectations as well as clearly knowing why the student is taking the course is incredibly helpful for themselves, and for you to keep them accountable. Student Support Checklist CORE DUTY #1: Making your support felt \u00b6 Our students need to know that you are with them and care for their progress . Reach out to them regularly to ask how things are going, or share an interesting link with them. We want each of our mentors to make every student feel truly supported . If possible, think of your students more as friends rather than sticking to a stiff and formal student-teacher relationship. Like good friends, we want students to feel that we are here for them when they need us. Laughter and friendship go a long way in making sure the learning process is fun, and therefore also productive. Get to know your student \u00b6 When you are assigned to a student, we will send you their background info . Use your first call to ask them about themselves, and tell them a little bit about yourself as well. Getting to know each other and exchanging personal thoughts is often nicer on a video call than in writing. We also recommend keeping a document with info about your students. It helps to keep track of their individual wishes, motivations, and concerns. These notes are for yourself, but ultimately to improve the individual experience for each of your students. If you want you can copy and use the example draft below: Student Notes Stay up-to-date with your students' progress \u00b6 Knowing where your students are currently at, what they have succeeded to do and what they might be struggling with, is an important piece in making them understand that we care for their learning process and progress. Our platform offers ways to stay up-to-date with your students' progress. Here are instructions on how to find your students' progress logs. Please bookmark these pages for quick access. Before your call, make sure to check where they are at. This will also help you find topics to discuss if your student doesn't have any specific questions. How to find student progress logs Student submissions and grading \u00b6 Our platform includes auto-graded submissions, as well as other types of submissions that are set up to be manually graded. We are planning to include some form of grading into the mentor's responsibilities since it is motivating for students to see written feedback and encouragement regarding their submissions when done by a thoughtful and supportive mentor. However, the way these manual submissions are currently set up is only as check-in points for students . Therefore, you do not currently need to grade student submissions . CORE DUTY #2: Weekly 1-on-1 calls \u00b6 Alongside with making sure our students feel supported and taken care of during their learning process, the weekly 45-minute 1-on-1 calls are what constitute our core mentorship offering. Using Zoom for scheduling, video sessions, and recordings Set a fixed meeting time \u00b6 Schedule the 1-on-1 with your student at a fixed recurring time every week . Send a recurring calendar invite for your weekly meetings so it's on both your calendars. Use your first call to lock in a time slot, then stick to it. No one enjoys the back-and-forth of trying to figure out a time, and we're aware that you have more important (and more fun) things to do with your time. What to talk about? \u00b6 During your 1-on-1 call, you review their labs together and discuss their code . These labs are the content of their aforementioned submissions. \u201cGrading\u201d these submissions, therefore, happens in a live discussion with the student, rather than separate from the call. This allows students to ask specific questions and brings about a more organic discussion regarding their code. You will discuss challenging concepts from the course materials if the student has not quite gotten a grip on them yet. Interested students have interesting questions! Help them find the answers. You are there to help them get unstuck, and help them learn how to get unstuck by themselves. Finally, you will help them create study schedules , set realistic expectations , and check in with them on their progress. You are there to hold them accountable for their plans. Help them set generous plans for themselves so that they will be able to stick to their plans. In short, during your 1-on-1 session you should: Review labs and project code together Discuss course-related concepts Answer student questions Help them schedule and stick to their plans Record your video sessions \u00b6 Please, screen-record every student 1-on-1 call . Having their mentor session recorded is useful for the students because then they can refer back to the video file after their call. Students can thereby re-watch helpful parts of a meeting. Some students will be more relaxed during the call since they know they can always come back and check if they think they missed something. It also helps us to refer to a shared resource, if any problems should arise. Recorded sessions also give us the possibility to provide feedback and suggestions to you regarding mentorship. We won't peek into your sessions unless you ask for feedback, or in case there seems to be any trouble. We will always communicate this to you beforehand, and accessing your video recordings will always happen while in communication with you. Session Reports \u00b6 At the end of each session, we ask you to give a short report on how it went that day. Linked below you will find a Google Form with a few questions. Please bookmark this form, and submit a filled-out copy after every call . This recap will not be visible to your student nor to other mentors, but only to you and the CodingNomads team. We want to keep it short so it doesn't take much of your time. However, consistently keeping short recaps is helpful. Session Report Form Time tracking with Toggl \u00b6 To keep track of the time you spend on mentoring your students, please use the Toggl time tracker. Toggl is easy to use and makes time tracking (nearly) effortless. Your Toggl Report will be submitted with your invoice each month for payment. How to use Toggl for CodingNomads time tracking Troubleshooting \u00b6 Check out our FAQ page .

These notes are suggestions that you can pick from in order to improve your work as a mentor. It is also meant to be a living document, so please feel free to add sections that you find helpful in order to spread your insights to the rest of our mentor community. How to be a great mentor Know your student - take notes! You are a guide Let them teach Study Groups How to create functioning study groups? Have a plan - and push them to know it! Peer reviews Code Reviews Code Repository Updates Know your student - take notes! \u00b6 Keep track of your student's progress (use the platform for help) Take notes after calls (you can make a copy of this pre-set doc ) You are a guide \u00b6 Explain to your students that you are here as a guide. You cannot fill knowledge into their heads, and you won't be with them all the time. However, you are there to help them navigate through the learning maze. Help them take the right turns, and make it easier for them to see the path they need to walk and assist them in taking the necessary steps. Let them teach \u00b6 You can explain a concept to your mentee if they don't yet have it all figured out. Next time you see someone ask the same question e.g. on the Forum, try to give your first mentee a chance to explain it to the next person! Send them a link, remind them that you went over this together, and ask them to answer the question for the other student. Explaining a concept to someone else is a very effective learning tool. Study Groups \u00b6 Study groups are awesome! They bring great results for learners. However, it is hard to make productive study groups work well remotely. Therefore, most of the time your mentee will learn by themselves. If you see an opportunity to make their learning more social, e.g. by connecting them with one of your other mentees if they are working on a similar challenge - please feel free to make and encourage that connection. How to create functioning study groups? \u00b6 Can we ascertain similar interests and levels of expertise in different mentees across all mentors and find ways to group them together? Happy for your input and ideas... Have a plan - and push them to know it! \u00b6 It's easy to procrastinate if you don't have a plan. One of your tasks is to make it as easy as possible for your mentees to have a clear and actionable plan that is scheduled on their calendar. Students need to: Know what they are expected to do very clearly Have a time plan on when they will work on it Understand when they'll want to have it done Have accountability for their plans and their workload As a mentor, you can be a great help with helping them to set up a study plan, make sure that it is realistic so they won't get frustrated by constantly not meeting their aims, have your students assign time slots on their calendars, and finally also provide accountability by checking back with them to see whether they are sticking to the plan. It helps to explain that they can split themselves into two personalities for getting things done: The benevolent planner The diligent executioner During planning, you need to keep your own best interests in mind. How much time can I really set aside for this, and when? How much can I really get done during a time slot? Suggest them to set their time slots and goals according to a benevolent plan that they create for themselves. This is important for the second phase - execution. If you set yourself up for a productive and motivating time during your planning session, then it'll be much easier to sit down as planned and simply execute. Not having to worry about whether it's a good thing you're doing right now (etc.) make for much more productive work sessions. Peer reviews \u00b6 Show the other mentors your work. Allow them to learn from you and learn from them and their feedback. Small circles of people that have a strong interest in something and stick together to openly, constructively, criticize each other - that's how specialized groups of people develop. It would be awesome if we together developed ourselves as an elite group of awesome code mentors that are close to each other, highly skilled, super effective in teaching students to code, and essentially can go out and rule the world! ;) Code Reviews \u00b6 We're currently using GitHub in-line comments for code review. This gets students more familiar with additional functionality in GitHub and makes it easy for us to provide well-formatted and on-the-spot feedback. There are some downsides to it. E.g. it's difficult to code review for students who commit code often because a piece of code you are providing feedback on might not be the most recent version. What helps with this is to always start at doing your code review on the latest commit. Code Repository Updates \u00b6 Students should have easy access to code examples and exercises. We host our code on GitHub. Labs and example code are provided in a well-structured repository that students can download and push to their own GitHub. Students should also set up a second remote that is pointing to the original repo . We will keep the original repo up-to-date, e.g. with feedback received from you and your students. Students can then pull updates from that second remote.","title":"On Mentorship"},{"location":"04_how_to_mentor/#how-to-be-a-great-mentor","text":"This document contains tips and ideas gathered from experience working with students both online and in person.

One of your tasks is to make it as easy as possible for your mentees to have a clear and actionable plan that is scheduled on their calendar. Students need to: Know what they are expected to do very clearly Have a time plan on when they will work on it Understand when they'll want to have it done Have accountability for their plans and their workload As a mentor, you can be a great help with helping them to set up a study plan, make sure that it is realistic so they won't get frustrated by constantly not meeting their aims, have your students assign time slots on their calendars, and finally also provide accountability by checking back with them to see whether they are sticking to the plan. It helps to explain that they can split themselves into two personalities for getting things done: The benevolent planner The diligent executioner During planning, you need to keep your own best interests in mind. How much time can I really set aside for this, and when? How much can I really get done during a time slot? Suggest them to set their time slots and goals according to a benevolent plan that they create for themselves. This is important for the second phase - execution. If you set yourself up for a productive and motivating time during your planning session, then it'll be much easier to sit down as planned and simply execute. Not having to worry about whether it's a good thing you're doing right now (etc.) make for much more productive work sessions.","title":"Have a plan - and push them to know it!"},{"location":"04_how_to_mentor/#peer-reviews","text":"Show the other mentors your work.

I'm excited to be working with you. I'll send along some scheduling information shortly so that we can set up our first meeting. If you'd like, we'd love for you to post an introduction about yourself on the Introductions thread in our forum when you get a chance. Looking forward to meeting you :) Intro Follow-up email \u00b6 Hi again {STUDENT_NAME}, I sent you a Slack message with this same info, and I want to email it too to make sure it reaches you. Let's try to keep our conversations in Slack moving forward. Slack is designed for conversation, and it's easier to keep our communication in one place. Sorry for the duplicate info if you already saw this on Slack :) I'm hoping to set up a call with you for this week so that we can get to know each other and touch base on learning methods, priorities, goals, etc., as we'll make sure that you're all set up and ready to get started. I'm currently in {MENTOR_LOCATION}, so my time zone is {MENTOR_TIMEZONE}. You're currently in {STUDENT_LOCATION}, right? Let me know which times work best regarding your schedule. I put the times that will work best for me for our first call in this scheduling tool linked below. Please vote on the listed time that works best for you. If you don't see a time that works for you, please write back and we'll figure something else out: {SCHEDULING_LINK} This meeting time is primarily for our first call, but if it works well, we can use the same time slot for our recurring meeting times moving forward, too. Looking forward to hearing from you, {MENTOR_NAME} CodingNomads Slack response + forum prompt \u00b6 Hi {STUDENT_NAME}! Great to hear from you! : ) You're welcome to contact me here on slack any time, and you can also use the {COURSE_CHANNEL} channel for any course and content-related thoughts. You can also use any other channel here that makes sense to you! When you get the time, please write a quick intro on our forum: https://forum.codingnomads.co/t/introductions/29 The forum is a great resource for searching for, asking, discussing, and answering questions - talking about code essentially! Glad to have you on board and let me know if you need anything First call follow-up \u00b6 Hi {STUDENT_NAME}, Nice to meet you today! I'll post the recording from our call shortly in the Google Photos album that I shared with you. You'll always be able to re-watch our calls there. I'll also be sending you an invite for our call for next week at the time we discussed. As you go through coursework or other programming related projects, I hope you'll find a couple of opportunities to fill out this little questionnaire. Filling this out is primarily for the practice of stepping back when encountering challenging programming tasks. What you come up with is mostly for you, but if it ends up being helpful and you'd like to go over some results during an upcoming call, please mention it and we can talk about it more. Stepping back when a problem feels challenging at first glance Fill out the following 2 questions before attempting the challenge: What is the assignment or question? What do you feel you don't know about it, or which parts do you predict will be challenging? Fill out the next three questions after and during your attempt: Did you manage to figure it out? Did the things you listed in question num. 2 end up being relevant to the assignment? If so, did they end up being difficult aspects of the assignment? (If any) What resources did you use when working on the assignment? Please take note of ones that were helpful, and feel free to specify if any resources were particularly unhelpful... Attempt this exercise a couple of times. Copy paste it into a file, and jot down some notes to answer each question. Give this process a fair try, it could turn out to be helpful to have it as a record of your progress. On another note, here are some social accounts you can check out and follow. It's a great way to get involved into the larger programming community, and that helps with getting and staying excited about it all! :) {COURSE_SOCIAL_LINKS} That's it! Hope you have a nice week and again, please reach out by Slack if you have any questions. All the best, {MENTOR_NAME} Prepare students for Weekly Call \u00b6 Hi {STUDENT_NAME}! Our weekly call is coming up, and I want to make sure that you'll take the most from the time we have together.

I introduced code reviews, both that I can do them if they submit links, as well as that I'll want students to do it for each other on the Forum, if possible. They are originally from Veenendaal, which is fun for me because I spent two weeks there working with a friend on a startup idea. They've been working on a Django project before (a course platform, essentially) and they'll keep doing that while brushing up on the topics covered in our course. I introduced that it's very useful that they know something already, and that they'll be able to learn a lot through teaching others on the Forum. They're looking forward to the interactions and discussions. I think it will be helpful to direct them to use the Forums as often as possible since they could provide good contributions AND seem to learn very well through discussing and explaining topics.

They were a bit worried there'd be too much reading for their taste, but I explained about the labs and projects and that I'm happy to provide more project ideas and links to make it even more practical. That seemed to resound well with them.","title":"2019-05-02"},{"location":"13_student_notes/#2019-05-09","text":"They skimmed over the exercises and completed some that they didn't know so well yet (File I/O etc.). I introduced code reviews, both that I can do them if they submit links, as well as that I'll want students to do it for each other on the Forum, if possible. They are originally from Veenendaal, which is fun for me because I spent two weeks there working with a friend on a startup idea. They've been working on a Django project before (a course platform, essentially) and they'll keep doing that while brushing up on the topics covered in our course. I introduced that it's very useful that they know something already, and that they'll be able to learn a lot through teaching others on the Forum. They're looking forward to the interactions and discussions. I think it will be helpful to direct them to use the Forums as often as possible since they could provide good contributions AND seem to learn very well through discussing and explaining topics.","title":"2019-05-09"},{"location":"13_student_notes/#student-name","text":"","title":"Student Name"},{"location":"13_student_notes/#quick-info_1","text":"*","title":"Quick Info"},{"location":"13_student_notes/#interests_1","text":"*","title":"Interests"},{"location":"13_student_notes/#calls_1","text":"","title":"Calls"}]}
