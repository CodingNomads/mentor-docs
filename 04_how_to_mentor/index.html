<h1 id="know-your-student-take-notes">Know your student - take notes!<a class="headerlink" href="#know-your-student-take-notes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>Keep track of your student's progress (use the platform for help)</li>
<li>Take notes after calls (you can make a copy of <a href="../13_student_notes/">this pre-set doc</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="you-are-a-guide">You are a guide<a class="headerlink" href="#you-are-a-guide" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Explain to your students that you are here as a guide. You cannot fill knowledge into their heads, and you won't be with them all the time. However, you are there to help them navigate through the learning maze. Help them take the right turns, and make it easier for them to see the path they need to walk and assist them in taking the necessary steps.</p>
<h1 id="let-them-teach">Let them teach<a class="headerlink" href="#let-them-teach" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>You can explain a concept to your mentee if they don't yet have it all figured out. Next time you see someone ask the same question e.g. on the Forum, try to give your first mentee a chance to explain it to the next person! Send them a link, remind them that you went over this together, and ask them to answer the question for the other student. Explaining a concept to someone else is a very effective learning tool.</p>
<h1 id="study-groups">Study Groups<a class="headerlink" href="#study-groups" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Study groups are awesome! They bring great results for learners. However, it is hard to make productive study groups work well remotely. Therefore, most of the time your mentee will learn by themselves.</p>
<p>If you see an opportunity to make their learning more social, e.g. by connecting them with one of your other mentees if they are working on a similar challenge - please feel free to make and encourage that connection.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-create-functioning-study-groups">How to create functioning study groups?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-create-functioning-study-groups" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Can we ascertain similar interests and levels of expertise in different mentees across all mentors and find ways to group them together?</li>
<li><em>Happy for your input and ideas...</em></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="have-a-plan-and-push-them-to-know-it">Have a plan - and push them to know it!<a class="headerlink" href="#have-a-plan-and-push-them-to-know-it" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>It's easy to procrastinate if you don't have a plan. One of your tasks is to make it as easy as possible for your mentees to have a clear and actionable plan that is scheduled on their calendar.</p>
<p>Students need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Know what they are expected to do very clearly</li>
<li>Have a time plan on when they will work on it</li>
<li>Understand when they'll want to have it done</li>
<li>Have accountability for their plans and their workload</li>
</ol>
<p>As a mentor, you can be a great help with helping them to set up a study plan, make sure that it is realistic so they won't get frustrated by constantly not meeting their aims, have your students assign time slots on their calendars, and finally also provide accountability by checking back with them to see whether they are sticking to the plan.</p>
<p>It helps to explain that they can split themselves into two personalities for getting things done:</p>
<ol>
<li>The benevolent planner</li>
<li>The diligent executioner</li>
</ol>
<p>During planning, you need to keep your own best interests in mind. How much time can I really set aside for this, and when? How much can I really get done during a time slot?</p>
<p>Suggest them to set their time slots and goals according to a benevolent plan that they create for themselves. This is important for the second phase - execution.</p>
<p>If you set yourself up for a productive and motivating time during your planning session, then it'll be much easier to sit down as planned and simply execute. Not having to worry about whether it's a good thing you're doing right now (etc.) make for much more productive work sessions.</p>
<h1 id="peer-reviews">Peer reviews<a class="headerlink" href="#peer-reviews" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Show the other mentors your work. Allow them to learn from you and learn from them and their feedback. Small circles of people that have a strong interest in something and stick together to openly, constructively, criticize each other - that's how specialized groups of people develop.</p>
<p>It would be awesome if we together developed ourselves as an elite group of awesome code mentors that are close to each other, highly skilled, super effective in teaching students to code, and essentially can go out and rule the world! ;)</p>
<h1 id="code-reviews">Code Reviews<a class="headerlink" href="#code-reviews" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>We're currently using <strong>GitHub in-line comments</strong> for code review. This gets students more familiar with additional functionality in GitHub and makes it easy for us to provide well-formatted and on-the-spot feedback.</p>
<p>There are some downsides to it. E.g. it's difficult to code review for students who commit code often because a piece of code you are providing feedback on might not be the most recent version.</p>
<p>What helps with this is to always start at doing your code review on the latest commit.</p>
<h1 id="code-repository-updates">Code Repository Updates<a class="headerlink" href="#code-repository-updates" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Students should have easy access to code examples and exercises. We host our code on GitHub. Labs and example code are provided in a well-structured repository that students can download and push to their own GitHub.</p>
<p>Students should also <a href="http://forum.codingnomads.co/t/adding-a-second-remote/68">set up a second remote that is pointing to the original repo</a>. We will keep the original repo up-to-date, e.g. with feedback received from you and your students.</p>
<p>Students can then pull updates from that second remote.</p>
