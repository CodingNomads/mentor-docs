## Mentor Meeting Cancellations and Program Extensions

### Program Extension Requests

If students would like to request a program end-date extension for meeting reschedules or pauses, they must submit a [Program Extension Request Form](https://codingnomads.com/page/program-extension-request-form) to be approved by CodingNomads.


### Meeting Cancellations

A Meeting Cancellation refers to when a student cancels or otherwise misses a scheduled mentor meeting, and does not request a reschedule or program extension. Students have the right to cancel a mentor meeting at any time, and are not obligated to reschedule or request a program extension. We kindly ask that you notify your mentor at least 24 hours in advance of a cancellation. If a student does not provide 24 hour advance written notice before missing a scheduled mentor meeting, the meeting is considered canceled, cannot be rescheduled, and does not extend the program.

### Meeting Reschedules

Students may request to reschedule a mentor meeting by sending written notice to the mentor at least 24 hours in advance of the scheduled meeting. Meeting Reschedules are subject to mentor availability, and are not guaranteed.
When it is not possible to reschedule a meeting within the same calendar week, students may request a one (1) week program extension by submitting the Program Extension Request Form.

Students may request to reschedule up to two (2) mentor meetings per calendar month. If a student does not provide 24-hour advance written notice, the meeting cannot be rescheduled, and the program end date cannot be extended.

### Program Pauses

A Program Pause refers to when a student requests a planned period of time off from mentor meetings. Students who are enrolled in the mentorship program may request to pause their program on a single occasion for a maximum of 4 weeks. Any pause lasting more than 2 weeks may require a new assignment of mentor. Students may request that billing be paused for the duration of the pause, however, no such grant is guaranteed. Students must complete the Program Extension Request Form to be granted an end-date extension and / or billing pause during this pause. The easiest way to effectively pause a program is to withdraw from the month-to-month mentorship program and start again when ready.
