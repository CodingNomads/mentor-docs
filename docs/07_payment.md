# Mentors without a US bank account

For mentors who bank outside of the USA, we use **TransferWise** bank transfers, which charge the lowest recipient fee (~ 1%) and best exchange rate than any other service we've found.


## Please include the following information on your invoice for payment

*   Full name as listed on your bank account
*   Residential address on your bank account
    *   Street address
    *   City
    *   Country
    *   Postal code
*   Bank account number / IBAN
*   Currency type (must be a currency other than USD)
*   Name of bank
*   SWIFT-BIC code for your bank

# Mentors with a USA bank account

For mentors who bank within the USA, we use **Zelle** bank transfers.

*   All we need is the email address associated with your bank account.
*   If you are not already signed up with Zelle, you will receive an email at the address you provide with directions on how to complete the receipt of your payment.

US citizens must also fill the [Form W-9 for Independent Contractors](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxJrtYx-WJMEY2U1RmdvXzJrTHY4Mjlteld1cFkxSTJlaFpR/view?usp=sharing), and email the completed form to Kim: <img style="display: inline-block;" alt="contact address for kim" src="../images/email_kim.png"/>

# Monthly payment process

To receive payment, please email an invoice and Toggl CSV and PDF Report to Kim by the **fifth day of each month** following your monthly billing period: <img style="display: inline-block;" alt="contact address for kim" src="../images/email_kim.png"/>.

*   Here is an [invoice template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-o45pFgiwheTOZCKr38iPZHm9nUzdYUC79GbfePV380/edit?usp=sharing) that you can make a copy of and use. You can also use the invoice of your choosing.
*   Since you are keeping time in Toggl, you do not need to add more line items to the invoice unless you want a more detailed invoice for your own records. The Toggl **Detailed Report** will serve as an addendum to each invoice for our tax reporting purposes.

    *   [How to create a Toggle timesheet report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QprIGo-yMWRpYr8ncr-kUrbOLvX7yE_zP9uaQCa0lCM/edit#heading=h.mo6fr7cb5584)

*   Therefore, the hours on your Toggl report must match your Invoice for each month.
*   If you make changes to your Toggl timesheet after submitting your Invoice, you will need to modify and re-submit your Invoice to match the timesheet.

We will process your invoice no later than the 15th day of the month that you submitted your invoice. For example:

For the hours you worked in **December** you will submit an invoice by **January 5**, and you will be paid by **January 15**.
