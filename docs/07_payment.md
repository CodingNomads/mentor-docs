## Mentors Without A US Bank Account

For mentors who bank outside of the USA, we use **TransferWise** bank transfers, which charge the lowest recipient fee (~ 1%) and best exchange rate than any other service we've found.

Please **include the following information** on your invoice for payment:

- Full name as listed on your bank account
- Residential address on your bank account
  - Street address
  - City
  - Country
  - Postal code
- Bank account number / IBAN
- Currency type (must be a currency other than USD)
- Name of bank
- SWIFT-BIC code for your bank

## Mentors With A US Bank Account

For mentors who bank within the USA, we use **Zelle** bank transfers.

To send you payment, we only need:

- the **email address** associated with your bank account

If you are not already signed up with Zelle, you will receive an email at the address you provide with directions on how to complete the receipt of your payment.

US citizens must also fill the [Form W-9 for Independent Contractors](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf), and email the completed form to Kim: <img style="display: inline-block;" alt="contact address for kim" src="../images/email_kim.png"/>

## Monthly Payment Process

To receive payment, it is necessary that you have your time tracked with TopTracker and that you sent an invoice to <img style="display: inline-block;" alt="contact address for kim" src="../images/email_kim.png"/>.

You can make a copy of this [invoice template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-o45pFgiwheTOZCKr38iPZHm9nUzdYUC79GbfePV380/edit?usp=sharing) and use it. You can also use a different invoice of your choosing.

Please keep the following in mind:

- **Time Tracking:** Since you are keeping time in TopTracker, and we have access to these time entries, you don't need to send us anything apart from your invoice.
- **Hour Matching:** Please make sure that the hours on your TopTracker report matches your invoice each month.

We will process your invoice no later than the 15th day of the month that you submitted your invoice.

For example: For the hours you worked in **December** you will submit an invoice by **January 5**, and you will be paid by **January 15**.
