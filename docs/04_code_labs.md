# Coding exercises (Labs & Projects)

We want our students to **practice coding** as much as possible.

For this, we provide them with:

* Coding Quizzes (in-course)
* Labs & Projects (GitHub)

## Why code locally?

Unlike most online courses, we don't put our focus on an in-browser coding environment. Our focus is on:

* coding locally
* in a real-world environment
* training students to use all the tools and setup they will _actually_ use

Therefore, while we provide some auto-graded in-browser exercises, the **Labs & Projects** on GitHub, which students are meant to complete on their own local setup, are more important.

## Getting the Labs

Download the labs from the **in-course link** provided in the course you're working with. You can also fetch it here:

* [Python Labs](https://github.com/CodingNomads/python_fundamentals)
* [Java Labs](https://github.com/CodingNomads/online-java-fundamentals)

## Getting the Projects

Project instructions are linked individually when a student reaches a certain section. You can either access them through the course, or download the complete repository here:

* [Python Projects](https://github.com/CodingNomads/python_miniprojects)
* Java Projects

## Solution Code Repository

To assist you as a mentor with providing great assistance to your students, we offer <ins>private solution code repositories</ins>:

* [Python Labs & Projects Solutions Repo](https://github.com/martin-martin/python-fundamentals-solutions).
* Java Labs & Projects Solutions Repo

You will need to be accepted as a contributor. If you are an active mentor and you don't have access to the relevant repo, please write to <img style="display: inline-block;" alt="contact address for martin" src="../images/email_martin.png"/>.

**NOTE: Please avoid giving students answers directly!**

Learning new things only happens through struggle, training, and repetition. Therefore, handing out solutions will be a disservice to your students.

Prompt your students to trust the process, encourage them to keep trying themselves as well as consult [our forum](https://forum.codingnomads.co/) and you as their mentor for support and tips.

Make it clear to them that you are **trained to assist them in figuring out the solution by themselves** - which is the only way to increase their understanding and skills.
