# Coding Exercises (Labs & Projects)

We want our students to **practice coding** as much as possible.

For this, we provide them with:

- Coding Quizzes (in-course)
- Labs & Projects (GitHub)

During your 1:1 calls, **talk with your student about the code they wrote**. Discuss labs and project code, ask them _why_ they solved a challenge how they did, and give them hints about other possible solutions.

In short: **Talk about code!**. It really helps.

## Coding Locally

Unlike most online courses, we don't put our focus on an in-browser coding environment. Our focus is on:

- coding **locally**
- coding in a **real-world** environment
- **training** students to use all the tools and setup they will _actually_ use

We provide some auto-graded exercises in the browser, but the **Labs & Projects** on GitHub, which students are meant to complete on their own local setup, are more important.

## Getting The Labs

Download the labs from the **in-course link** provided in the course you're working with. You can also fetch it here:

- [Python Labs](https://github.com/CodingNomads/python_fundamentals)
- [Java Labs](https://github.com/CodingNomads/online-java-fundamentals)
- [Data Science & Machine Learning Labs](https://github.com/CodingNomads/data-science-machine-learning)
- [Django Labs](https://github.com/CodingNomads/django-web-dev)
- [Flask Labs](https://github.com/CodingNomads/flask-labs)
- [JavaScript Labs](https://github.com/CodingNomads/javascript-labs)
- [Quant Trading Labs](https://github.com/CodingNomads/quant-trading)

## Getting The Projects

Some project instructions might be linked individually after a student reaches a certain section. You can either access them through the course, or download the complete repository here:

- [Python Projects](https://github.com/CodingNomads/python_miniprojects)

## Getting Solution Code

To assist you as a mentor with providing great assistance to your students, we offer <ins>private solution code repositories</ins>:

- [Python Labs & Projects Solutions Repo](https://github.com/martin-martin/python-fundamentals-solutions)
- Java Labs & Projects Solutions Repo

You will need to be accepted as a contributor. If you are an active mentor and you don't have access to the relevant repo, please write to <img style="display: inline-block;" alt="contact address for martin" src="../images/email_martin.png"/>.

**NOTE: Please avoid giving students answers directly!**

Learning new things only happens through struggle, training, and repetition. Therefore, handing out solutions will be a disservice to your students.

Prompt your students to trust the process, encourage them to keep trying themselves as well as consult [our forum](https://forum.codingnomads.co/) and you as their mentor for support and tips.

Make it clear to them that you are **trained to assist them in figuring out the solution by themselves** - which is the only way to increase their understanding and skills.

## Getting Additional Practice

Please encourage your students to also use external coding practice tools. You may be familiar with a site that you enjoy using yourself. Introduce your student to them, form teams, and check on their progress. Whatever tool makes your student practice coding is a great addition to their learning process.

Here are a few external sites that you can consider for additional coding practice exercises:

- <a href='https://codingbat.com/' target='_blank'>CodingBat</a>
- <a href='https://www.hackerrank.com/auth/signup' target='_blank'>HackerRank</a>
- <a href='https://adventofcode.com/' target='_blank'>Advent of Code</a>
