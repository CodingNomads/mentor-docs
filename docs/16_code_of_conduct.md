- **Be Kind:** Please be incredibly kind, patient and understanding with your students.
- **Stay Kind:** Learning new, complex skills can be incredible tough, and very frustrating. Please Be Kind.
- **Don't Discriminate:** Chauvinism, sexism, racism, as well any and all other forms of discrimination, aggression, or hostility are not tolerated at CodingNomads. You can and will be removed from our mentorship ranks, and any other position you hold at CodingNomads after a single infraction.
