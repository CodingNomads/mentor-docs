# CodingNomads Mentor Community

We're all better in a bunch, and socially learning from your peers is a great and effective way to improve. At CodingNomads, we want to nurture a motivated community of mentors who care for what they do, for their students, and for each other. And we want to make an effort to help you help each other on the way of getting better at what you're already good at. :)

## Internal Communication

### Discord Channel

We have a mentor-only Discord channel called `#mentors-internal`. If you haven't been added, please contact <img style="display: inline-block;" alt="contact address for michael" src="../images/email_michael.png"/>.

### Mentor Forum Section

Our forum has a _Staff_ section that is invisible to students. Use the _Mentorship_ category to post and discuss ideas with your fellow mentors and the rest of our team.

## Mentor Team Meetings

We'll aim to have mentor team meetings from time to time so we stay in sync with each other and exchange mentorship related knowledge and ideas. These meetings are also meant as an opportunity to discuss possible ways to improve our mentor community.

Bring your ideas and suggestions! This call will be compensated per your normal hourly rate. We appreciate your time and your input!

## Peer Reviews

Show the other mentors your work. Allow them to learn from you and learn from them and their feedback. Small circles of people that have a strong interest in something and stick together to openly, constructively, critique each other, that's how specialized groups of people develop.

We aim to develope ourselves as an elite group of awesome code mentors that are close-knite, highly skilled, and super effective in teaching students to code!
