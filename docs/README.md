# #StayAtHome COVID-19 Mentorship Program

If you are a volunteer mentor with the [#StayAtHome program](https://github.com/CodingNomads/stayathome-mentorship/blob/master/README.md), several sections in these docs will not apply to you. Please feel free to use them as a reference and guide for conducting quality and effective mentorship.

**Here's the tl;dr page: [Mentorship Practical Tips](14_tips.md)**

And some more links to relevant sections:

- **[What Mentorship Means To Us](01_requirements.md#what-does-mentorship-mean-to-us)**: Thoughts on why good mentorship can make a huge difference
- **[How To Be A Great Mentor](04_how_to_mentor.md)**: Thoughts on ways to approach mentorship (more theoretical)
- **[Mentorship Process Blueprint](03_mentorship_process.md)**: Suggestions and step-by-step tips on how to conduct an effective mentorship session (no need to read further than "Record your video sessions") (more practical)
- **[Tools For Mentors](05_tools.md)**: Processes, programs and tools that can be helpful to support you when conducting mentorship
- **[Student Support Checklist](08_checklist.md)**: Quick checklist to keep most important points in mind

The info below is part of our regular mentorship docs, so some of it will not be relevant if you are here for the #StaAtHome Mentorship Effort. Feel free to read on.
