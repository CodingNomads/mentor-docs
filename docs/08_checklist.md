# Student Support Checklist

_You can print this page to make sure you check off your tasks for supporting your students._

<ins>The most important thing is to make sure your student understands that you care for them and their learning progress</ins>!

## Setup Support

- [] Read their background information
- [] Scheduled a one-time orientation call
- [] Set up a fixed weekly meeting time calendar event with Zoom
- [] Clarified that the meeting time should be as firm as possible since re-scheduling might not be possible.
- [] Clarified that you're there to help them, and also that it's their own effort that makes or breaks their learning progress.

## Recurring Support

- Check in with them via chat frequently
  - Any questions?
  - Any interesting links you found that you can share with them?
- [Keep a document](13_student_notes.md) with notes on their wishes, struggles, and info on their progress and process in general
- Conduct weekly 1-on-1 video chat sessions
  - Discuss any questions that students have
  - Together check up on the lab/project code they wrote and give them actionable feedback
  - Help them create a schedule and stay accountable
- Write and submit a support log in the [mentor portal](https://codingnomads.com/mentor-portal)

These are the required tasks when you mentor for CodingNomads students. Of course, we welcome any additional involvement - [here are some thoughts and suggestions](04_how_to_mentor.md).
