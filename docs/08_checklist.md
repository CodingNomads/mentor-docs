# Student Support Checklist

_You can print this page to make sure you check off your tasks for supporting your students._

Most important is to make your student **understand that you care for them and their learning progress**.

# Getting Started

*   Received and read their background information
*   Scheduled a one-time orientation call
*   Set up a fixed weekly meeting time calendar event with Zoom
*   Clarified that the meeting time should be as firm as possible since re-scheduling might not be possible.
*   Clarified that you're there to help them and that it's their effort that makes the biggest difference

# Recurring Support

*   Check in with them via chat frequently
    *   Any questions?
    *   Any interesting links you found that you can share with them?
*   [Keep a document](13_student_notes.md) with notes on their wishes, struggles, and info on their progress and process in general
*   Conduct weekly 45-minute 1-on-1 video chat sessions
    *   Discuss any questions that students have
    *   Together check up on the lab/project code they wrote and give them actionable feedback
    *   Help them create a schedule and stay accountable
*   Fill and submit the [session report](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfcYcVSnGAIhEB4wNr4tURIqQ_6lRa0xo7ARpWeDuhFq9a7bA/viewform)

These are the required tasks for mentoring for CodingNomads. We welcome any additional involvement from your side - [here are some thoughts and suggestions](04_how_to_mentor.md).

We can pay up to 1.5 hours of your work time per week per student.
