# What to do if you're a new Mentor

We are aware that no one knows everything, and that it takes some time to get familiar when working in a new system. Therefore, **we provide you with up to 6 hours of paid onboarding time** at your normal rate.

[TOC]

# Mentor Onboarding Process

During your paid onboarding time, you are expected to use this time to complete the following tasks thoroughly:

*   Set up TopTracker and start recording your time
*   Read the Mentor docs to make yourself familiar with CodingNomads' mentorship process, logistics, and expectations
*   Set up your system with the necessary software and give everything a test-run:
    *   Install Zoom and making sure you understand the workflow for scheduling and conducting a 1-on-1 meeting
    *   Explore TopTracker and go through the process of recording your time
*   Log in to our learning platform and get familiar with its navigation, as well as where you can keep track of students' progress
*   Skim over the whole course content, so that you understand the course structure, which topics we discuss, and how we approach them
*   Clone the relevant GitHub repository that contains the labs for your course and look into the code to make sure you understand the instructions
*   Sign up for and introduce yourself on our Discussion Forum

You don't need to go through the course that you're mentoring for in depth. However, we'd want you to already be familiar with the topics the course covers.

It is your responsibility to know what the course contains and what the students are learning each week. Also, make sure that you are familiar with the associated labs on GitHub, so you'll be able to guide your students' through their questions efficiently.

As their mentor and guide you need to be aware of your students' tasks as well as their progress.

# Mentor Onboarding Tasks

To help you complete all the necessary steps, follow the tasks and answer the questions in our Mentor Onboarding Tasks Form as you read through the rest of the Mentor docs.

At this point, you might not yet know how to complete all the tasks and questions, but after reading through all documents this should be possible.

**You are required to submit the completed form as part of your onboarding process.** So open up the form and keep it by your side as you read on.
